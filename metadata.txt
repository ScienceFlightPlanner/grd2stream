about=This plugin allows to comfortably generate multiple flowlines from velocity grids by selecting seed points (using Runge-Kutta integration methods). It utilizes GMT6 to ensure compatibility with all GDAL file formats! The plugin installs GMT6 in an isolated Conda environment, which does not affect any existing native GMT6 installations on your system.
